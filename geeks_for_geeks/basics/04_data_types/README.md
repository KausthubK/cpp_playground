# Data Types

From [Geeks for Geeks - C Data Types Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-data-types/)

## Types

1. Primitive Data Types:

    These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
    - Integer
    - Character
    - Boolean
    - Floating Point
    - Double Floating Point
    - Valueless or Void
    - Wide Character

1. Derived Data Types

    The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
    - Function
    - Array
    - Pointer
    - Reference

1. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types:

    These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
    - Class
    - Structure
    - Union
    - Enumeration
    - Typedef defined DataType
